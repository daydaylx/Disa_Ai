# Project Summary

## Overall Goal

Implement a mobile-first responsive design for the Disa AI application with optimized touch interactions, accessibility compliance, and adaptive layouts for all device sizes.

## Key Knowledge

- Technology stack: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React icons
- Mobile-first approach using CSS flexbox/grid with progressive enhancement
- Touch target minimum size: 48px with enhanced feedback for mobile interactions
- Accessibility focus: WCAG AA compliance with proper focus management and ARIA attributes
- Safe area handling for notched mobile devices using CSS env() variables
- Performance considerations: Lazy loading, GPU acceleration, reduced motion support
- Key components identified: ChatV2, Models, Studio (Roles) pages
- Existing mobile components: MobileOnlyGate, BottomNavigation, TopAppBar
- Viewport height optimization using dynamic viewport units (dvh) and JavaScript calculation
- CSS class naming follows mobile-first pattern with "mobile-" prefixes
- Critical issue identified: Code duplication between MobileChatV2.tsx and ChatV2.tsx
- Performance bottlenecks in re-renders and DOM manipulation
- Consistency issues in component naming and accessibility implementation

## Recent Actions

- Analyzed existing UI structure including ChatV2, Models, and Studio pages
- Created mobile-enhanced CSS files with responsive design tokens and utilities
- Developed mobile-optimized components: MobileNavigation, MobileHeader, MobileAppShell
- Implemented touch-optimized UI elements with proper sizing and feedback
