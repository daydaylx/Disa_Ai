# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement a mobile-first responsive design for the Disa AI application with optimized touch interactions, accessibility compliance, and adaptive layouts for all device sizes.

## Key Knowledge
- Technology stack: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React icons
- Mobile-first approach using CSS flexbox/grid with progressive enhancement
- Touch target minimum size: 48px with enhanced feedback for mobile interactions
- Accessibility focus: WCAG AA compliance with proper focus management and ARIA attributes
- Safe area handling for notched mobile devices using CSS env() variables
- Performance considerations: Lazy loading, GPU acceleration, reduced motion support
- Key components identified: ChatV2, Models, Studio (Roles) pages
- Existing mobile components: MobileOnlyGate, BottomNavigation, TopAppBar
- Viewport height optimization using dynamic viewport units (dvh) and JavaScript calculation

## Recent Actions
