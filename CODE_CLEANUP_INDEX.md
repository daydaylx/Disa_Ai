| Undefined Variables  | 5 vars  | -           | LOW            | Fix          |
| Unused Classes       | 40+     | 170         | LOW            | Remove       |
| Redundant Variables  | 20+     | 48          | MEDIUM         | Consolidate  |
| TypeScript Dead Code | minimal | -           | LOW            | ESLint scan  |
| **TOTAL CLEANUP**    | -       | **252-292** | **LOW-MEDIUM** | **3 phases** |

### Cleanup Impact

- **Safe Removal:** 252 lines (Phase 1)
- **With Consolidation:** 292 lines (Phase 1-2)
- **CSS Bundle Reduction:** 5-8% minified, 3-4% gzipped
- **Timeline:** 30-45 min (Phase 1), 2-3 hours (all phases)
- **Risk Level:** LOW → MEDIUM → HIGH across phases

---

## Quick Action Items

### For This Week (Phase 1 - 30 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Delete duplicate file
rm /src/styles/bottomsheet.css

# 2. Fix undefined variables in chat-mobile.css
# (see CLEANUP_QUICK_START.md for exact changes)

# 3. Remove unused classes from base.css
# (see CLEANUP_QUICK_START.md for exact line numbers)

# 4. Test
npm run dev
npm run build
```

### For Next Week (Phase 2 - 1.5-2 hours)

- Consolidate mobile variables to tokens.css
- Audit orphaned variables
- Verify all mobile-first variables in single source

### For Next Sprint (Phase 3 - 2-3 hours)

- Audit components.css (2000+ lines)
- Identify unused component classes
- Requires manual review + testing

## Key Findings at a Glance

### Critical (Fix Immediately)

- `/src/styles/bottomsheet.css` - 100% duplicate of base.css

### Important (Fix This Week)

- `chat-mobile.css` - uses 5 undefined CSS variables
- `base.css` - contains 170 lines of unused helper classes

### Maintenance (Plan for Next Sprint)

- `mobile-enhanced.css` - variables should move to tokens.css
- `components.css` - large file needs comprehensive audit

---

## Before You Start

1. **Read:** CLEANUP_QUICK_START.md (10 min)
2. **Review:** High-risk areas with team (5 min)
3. **Plan:** Which phase to implement (5 min)
4. **Test:** Ensure you can run `npm run dev` locally
5. **Branch:** Create feature branch for cleanup

---

## During Cleanup

1. **Follow:** Step-by-step instructions from CLEANUP_QUICK_START.md
2. **Test:** Run dev server after each major change
3. **Verify:** Bundle size reduction with `npm run build`
4. **Document:** Any unexpected issues or findings
5. **Commit:** Atomic commits (one per phase)

---

## After Cleanup

1. **Test:** Full test suite passes
2. **Visual:** No regressions on all breakpoints
3. **Performance:** Bundle size reduced as expected
4. **Accessibility:** All a11y features functional
5. **PR:** Create comprehensive pull request with findings

---

## Metrics to Track

**Before Cleanup:**

```bash
npm run build
du -h dist/style.*.css    # Record CSS bundle size
grep -c "^\." src/styles/*.css  # Record total classes
```

**After Phase 1:**

```bash
npm run build
du -h dist/style.*.css    # Compare size (should be ~5% smaller)
# Test critical paths
```

**After Phase 2:**

```bash
npm run build
# Final metrics
# Document results in PR description
```

---

## Rollback Instructions

If anything breaks:

```bash
# Immediate rollback
git revert HEAD --no-edit

# Or revert to specific commit
git reset --hard <before-cleanup-commit>

# Then investigate what went wrong
```

## FAQ

**Q: Why delete bottomsheet.css?**
A: It's 100% duplicate of code in base.css. No components reference it directly - CSS consolidation handles imports.

**Q: Will removing unused classes break anything?**
A: No. We verified with grep searches that no .tsx/.ts files use these classes. Safe removal.

**Q: What about the undefined variables?**
A: They silently fallback to browser defaults. Replacing with defined alternatives is safer and ensures correct styling.

**Q: How long will this take?**
A: Phase 1 = 30 min, Phase 2 = 1.5-2 hrs, Phase 3 = 2-3 hrs (requires review)

**Q: Is this risky?**
A: Phase 1 is LOW risk (verified duplicates). Phase 2 is MEDIUM (test all breakpoints). Phase 3 is HIGH (large file).

**Q: Can we do partial cleanup?**
A: Yes! Phase 1 is safe standalone. Start there, see results, then plan Phase 2.
