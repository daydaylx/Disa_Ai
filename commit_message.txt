feat(ui): Centralize optical design tokens for enhanced consistency

Refactored UI styling by introducing and utilizing CSS variables for key optical properties,
improving maintainability and fine-tuning capabilities.

- **Glassmorphism Refinement:** Centralized control over blur strength, surface opacity,
  shadow opacity, and border opacity using new CSS variables (`--glass-blur-strength`,
  `--glass-surface-opacity`, `--glass-shadow-opacity`, `--glass-border-opacity`).
- **Color Palette Harmony:** Introduced `--accent-mix-percentage` for consistent accent
  color intensity in interactive states.
- **Typography Polish:** Moved all typography definitions (font sizes, line heights,
  weights, letter spacing) to CSS variables, including fluid typography with `clamp()`,
  and updated component styles to consume these.
- **Animation & Micro-Interaction Smoothness:** Added missing motion duration variables
  and introduced variables for ripple effect properties (`--size-ripple-max`,
  `--ripple-opacity`), centralizing control over animation timing and micro-interactions.
