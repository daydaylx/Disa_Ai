# ADR-001: Infrastructure Consolidation & Standards

**Date:** 2025-01-19
**Status:** Accepted
**Scope:** Deployment, Package Management, Security Headers, Development Process

## Context

The project had accumulated infrastructure inconsistencies and unclear deployment strategies that were causing confusion and potential production issues:

1. **Headers Duplication:** Multiple `_headers` files with different configurations
2. **Deployment Ambiguity:** Unclear primary deployment platform (Cloudflare vs GitHub Pages)
3. **Package Manager Confusion:** Mixed references to npm and pnpm
4. **Missing CSP Process:** No clear process for Content Security Policy changes
5. **PR Quality Issues:** Organizational PRs without clear purpose

## Decisions

### 1. Primary Deployment Platform: Cloudflare Pages
**Decision:** Cloudflare Pages is the single source of truth for production deployments

**Rationale:**
- Already configured with proper CI/CD
- Superior performance with global CDN
- Better security headers support
- Automatic HTTPS and caching

**Actions Taken:**
- Removed duplicate `/_headers` file from root
- Kept `public/_headers` as canonical source
- Updated documentation to reflect Cloudflare as primary

### 2. Package Manager Standardization: npm
**Decision:** npm is the official package manager for this project

**Rationale:**
- `package-lock.json` is present and committed
- All CI/CD scripts use npm
- Consistent with Node.js ecosystem defaults
- Avoids dependency management conflicts

**Actions Taken:**
- Updated README.md to specify npm only
- Removed pnpm references from documentation
- Commented out `.pnpm-store/` in `.gitignore`

### 3. Security Headers Management
**Decision:** Implement formal CSP change process with documentation

**Rationale:**
- CSP changes can introduce security vulnerabilities
- Need clear approval process for external resources
- Documentation prevents ad-hoc security decisions
- Enables security audits and compliance

**Actions Taken:**
- Created `docs/SECURITY_HEADERS.md` with change process
- Documented current CSP configuration
- Provided examples for common scenarios
- Added validation requirements

### 4. PR Hygiene Standards
**Decision:** Establish clear PR guidelines with anti-patterns

**Rationale:**
- Improve code review quality
- Reduce merge conflicts and technical debt
- Better change tracking and rollback capability
- Clearer communication of changes

**Actions Taken:**
- Created `docs/PR_GUIDELINES.md`
- Defined PR types and required elements
- Documented anti-patterns to avoid
- Provided examples of good descriptions

## Implementation

### Immediate Actions (Completed)
- [x] Remove duplicate headers file
- [x] Update package manager references
- [x] Create security headers documentation
- [x] Create PR guidelines documentation
- [x] Commit all changes

### Follow-up Actions (Recommended)
- [ ] Add PR template enforcement in GitHub
- [ ] Create CSP violation monitoring in production
- [ ] Schedule quarterly security headers audit
- [ ] Train team on new processes

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Clarity:** Single source of truth for deployment and dependencies
- **Security:** Formal process for security-sensitive changes
- **Quality:** Better PR descriptions and review process
- **Maintainability:** Clear documentation for future contributors

### Risks
- **Process Overhead:** Additional documentation to maintain
- **Adoption:** Team needs to learn new processes
- **Enforcement:** Requires consistent application of guidelines

### Mitigation
- Keep processes lightweight and practical
- Lead by example in PRs
- Regular process review and refinement
- Automate where possible (linting, checks)

## Monitoring

We will measure success through:
- Reduced deployment issues and 404 errors
- Fewer security header misconfigurations
- Improved PR review times and quality
- Reduced build/dependency conflicts
