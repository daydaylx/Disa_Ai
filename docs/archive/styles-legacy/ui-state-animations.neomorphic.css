/**
 * Universal UI State Animations - NEOMORPHIC LEGACY VERSION

 * This file has been archived due to the migration away from neomorphic design.
 * All neomorphic-specific animations and utilities have been moved to a 
 * modern, token-based system.

/* Original neomorphic animations and effects can be found in:
 * - docs/archive/styles-legacy/ (original neomorphic-utilities.css)
 * - src/styles/components.css (legacy neomorphic classes replaced with modern counterparts)
 * - src/styles/tokens.css (new shadow and animation tokens)
